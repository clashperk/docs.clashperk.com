# Clan Alias

&#x20;Clan Alias feature allows users to set short, custom names for clans, making it quicker and easier to reference them in commands.

#### Autocomplete is great, but it can sometimes take a moment to appear. Clan aliases solve this problem by offering a faster alternative. Instead of waiting for autocomplete to load, simply type the alias and hit Enter.

#### Example:

For a series of clans like Air Hounds, Air Hounds 2, and Air Hounds 3, you could assign aliases like AH, AH2, and AH3. This means you can use:

\


/clan tag: AH &#x20;

\


to refer to Air Hounds directly.

\


Multiple Aliases:

\


Clan aliases are especially useful for commands like /summary and /export, where you can enter multiple aliases to search for specific clans.

\


Example:

\


/summary clans: AH AH2 &#x20;

\


Versatility:

\


Aliases can also be used in rosters and nicknames, making them a powerful tool for efficient clan management.
