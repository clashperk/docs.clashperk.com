  consequences like bans or strikes. It's a mechanism to maintain order and
  uphold community standards.

# Flags (Ban/Strike)

## Ban

When a player receives a banned flag, it usually means they have violated the community guidelines to such an extent that they are no longer allowed in the clan or family. This could be due to severe misconduct, cheating, harassment, or other serious offenses.

### Getting Alerts

When a banned player joins your clan or family, the bot can notify you in the Flag Alert Log.

## Strike

A strike flag, also known as a soft warning, is a milder form of penalty compared to a ban. It serves as a notification to the user that their behaviour has been noted and is not acceptable according to the clan's rules. Warning flags are often used for minor infractions or as a first step in a progressive disciplinary system.
