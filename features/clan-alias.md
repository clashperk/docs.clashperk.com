# Clan Alias

The clan Alias feature allows users to set short, custom names for clans, making it quicker and easier to reference them in commands.

Autocomplete is great, but it can sometimes take a moment to appear. Clan aliases solve this problem by offering a faster alternative. Instead of waiting for autocomplete to load, simply type the alias and hit Enter.

Example:

For a series of clans like Air Hounds, Air Hounds 2, and Air Hounds 3, you could assign aliases like AH, AH2, and AH3

You can use the following command to refer to Air Hounds directly.

```css
/clan tag: AH
```

Clan aliases are handy for commands like /summary and /export, where you can enter multiple aliases to search for specific clans.

```css
/summary clans: AH AH2
```

Aliases can also be used in rosters and nicknames, making them a powerful tool for efficient clan management.

### Create Alias

```css
/alias create clan: YOUR_CLAN alias_name: AH
```
