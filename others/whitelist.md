description: Whitelist a role or user to use specific commands.

# Whitelist (Experimental)

<mark style="color:red;">You can whitelist a role or a user. Only that role or user will be able to use a command once you whitelist a command. The command will be restricted for others, blocking them from using it unless they have other managerial roles or permissions.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">The whitelist is limited to commands and does not extend to buttons or select menus. For better control over both commands and buttons, utilize manager roles.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**/whitelist**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">**user\_or\_role:**</mark> `@User`  <mark style="color:purple;">**command:**</mark> `/link create` &#x20;
